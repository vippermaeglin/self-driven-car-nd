# Udacity - Self Driven Car Engineer #
* [https://udacity.com](https://udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)

Self-driving cars are set to revolutionize the way we live. This is transformational technology, on the cutting-edge of robotics, machine learning, software engineering, and mechanical engineering. In this program, we learn the skills and techniques used by self-driving car teams at the most advanced technology companies in the world like Google and Didi.

### Projects ###

* <a href="https://github.com/vippermaeglin/self-driven-car-nd/tree/master/P1%20-%20Lane%20Lines"> Finding Lane Lines on the Road</a>:
In this project I detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

* <a href="https://github.com/vippermaeglin/self-driven-car-nd/tree/master/P2%20-%20Traffic%20Sign%20Classifier"> Traffic Sign Classifier</a>:
In this project, I use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Specifically, I trained a model to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.
